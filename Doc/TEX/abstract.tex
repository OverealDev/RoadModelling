 During this coursework, I defined and simplified the concept of roads, which allows me to build two differents process of how to generate them graphically. Roads can be generated with minimal information : in the first approach, I used only circles in input to generate turns and straight lines. In the second approach, I used angles and distances. The main motivation was trying to understand how one can retro-engineer roads based on road dataset consisting of ordered points on a plane. My attempt of the retro-engineering process allows the user to detect straight lines of a sampled road dataset.
